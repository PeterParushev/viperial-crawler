#viperial-crawler


A simple web crawler used to download songs from viperial.

#The functionality so far:
The crawler connects to viperial.com and using a regex gets the IDs of songs that are interesting.
Those can be filtered by genre and a time period. He then proceeds to download the songs.
* The songs should be stored in directories by month.

#Future features:
* Qt UI because the one I have is bad in every way possible.

* I should see whether parallel execution will mess up the download process. If not I'll make it paralel.

* A installer/executable file. Something to support easy updates
